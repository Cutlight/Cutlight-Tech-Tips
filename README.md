## Welcome to Dunelight Tech Tips Paste, this is meant to be a general paste of just good-practice tips/suggestions for certain things to make your internet experience better.
## _If you're not using chrome or firefox, please go to the timeout corner._

First and foremost, most people I know online have no clue what their doing when it comes to their browser plugins. So here's a few suggestions. First the general stuff that I would say are ESSENTIAL, then the more niche plugins.

> Essential Plugins 

https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere/set-https-default-your-browser - Turning on HTTPS:// everywhere, keeps you safe while you browse.

https://ublockorigin.com/ - The only ad-blocker you'll ever need.

https://darkreader.org/ - Open source dark mode that you can configure site-based or just keep it on so all sites have dark mode by default.

> Niche Plugins 

https://www.one-tab.com/ - Saves & Converts tabs into list to save memory and your place so you can close your browser without worry.

https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/facebook-container - Keeps Facebook cookies and other crap from tracking you (Firefox only).

## Now, tweaks and mods for Windows
https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/winutil - CTT's winutil is a MUST HAVE for Windows tweaks and isn't some bloatware like CCleaner, you use it and when you're done it's done easy as that. I recommend watching his video if you need a tutorial on what to enable specifically. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXyMScSbhk4

https://www.oo-software.com/en/shutup10 -  Used to disable and turn off Windows built in spyware and tracking along with other tweaks. READ THROUGH SO YOU KNOW WHAT YOURE DISABLING.

https://www.bleachbit.org/ - BleachBit is a amazing tool you can use to clean up your computer, I recommend using it bi-weekly if you have a cluttered computer. READ THROUGH SO YOU KNOW WHAT YOURE REMOVING.

https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701 - Windows Terminal to replace cmd prompt and powershell, can do it all. I only suggest doing this if you have basic knowledge of coding and commands on windows, it's not a essential to have just a quality of life change.

https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/releases/tag/v0.67.0 - PowerToys is a ESSENTIAL and amazing suite of tools for Windows like a spotlight search feature similar to MacOS, a Text Extractor from images, Color Picker, File Locksmith and a whole bunch of other cool stuff. I personally just spotlight search the most.

## Next, suggestions / alternatives
## Laptops
HP- https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/cat/laptops
LG - https://www.lg.com/us/laptops
Framework - https://frame.work/
All have their own benefits and downsides but it's really up to you.
If you're planning on gaming with this laptop, make sure it has more than 8GB of RAM as a bare minimum, along with that look at the graphics. It's important to note that any gaming focused laptop will be MUCH more expensive compared to one to daily as a school laptop or something simple.

## Anti Virus
Treat Anti Virus programs like tools, not armor that makes your computer invicible. Do not download crap that can has any potential to be harmful, getting baited into downloading malware is stupider than getting scammed by Baljeet from Microsoft Headquarters

https://www.malwarebytes.com/ - Malwarebytes has a good buisiness model, you can completely exit it out unlike trash AVs such as avast and is very lightweight. Another alernative to Malwarebytes would be ByteDefender, both are good.

https://www.kaspersky.com/downloads/internet-security - Kaspersky has a suite of things and is kind bundled with other stuff. Decline the other apps and all the other crap and just their Anti Virus cuts no corners and will keep you as safe as you can be.
## DNS

It allows you to block or allow specific domains, view your network activity, and customize your settings.
## VPNs

## 2FA Apps
