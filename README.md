## Welcome to Cutlight Tech Tips Paste, this is meant to be a general paste of just good-practice tips/suggestions for certain things to make your internet experience better.
## _If you're not using chrome of firefox, please go to the timeout corner._

First and foremost, most people I know online have no clue what their doing when it comes to their browser plugins. So here's a few suggestions. First the general stuff that I would say are ESSENTIAL, then the more niche plugins.


- Essential Plugins
https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere/set-https-default-your-browser - Turning on HTTPS:// everywhere, keeps you safe while you browse.

[https://ublockorigin.com/] - The only ad-blocker you'll ever need.

[https://darkreader.org/] - Open source dark mode that you can configure site-based or just keep it on so all sites have dark mode by default.

- Niche Plugins
[https://www.one-tab.com/] - Saves & Converts tabs into list to save memory and your place so you can close your browser without worry.
[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/facebook-container] - Keeps Facebook cookies and other crap from tracking you (Firefox only).

## Now, tweaks and mods for Windows
- [https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/winutil] 
CTT's winutil is a MUST HAVE for Windows tweaks and isn't some bloatware like CCleaner, you use it and when you're done it's done easy as that. I recommend watching his video if you need a tutorial on what to enable specifically. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXyMScSbhk4

- [https://www.oo-software.com/en/shutup10] 
Used to disable and turn off Windows built in spyware and tracking along with other tweaks. READ THROUGH SO YOU KNOW WHAT YOURE DISABLING.
- [https://www.bleachbit.org/]
BleachBit is a amazing tool you can use to clean up your computer, I recommend using it bi-weekly if you have a cluttered computer. READ THROUGH SO YOU KNOW WHAT YOURE REMOVING.

- [https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701]
Windows Terminal to replace cmd prompt and powershell, can do it all. I only suggest doing this if you have basic knowledge of coding and commands on windows, it's not a essential to have just a quality of life change.

- [https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/releases/tag/v0.67.0]
PowerToys is a ESSENTIAL and amazing suite of tools for Windows like a spotlight search feature similar to MacOS, a Text Extractor from images, Color Picker, File Locksmith and a whole bunch of other cool stuff. I personally just spotlight search the most.

## Next, suggestions / alternatives
> VPNs
- https://mullvad.net/en/ 
Mullvad VPN is the best of the best and there's no point in even arguing. 

> Authenticator
- https://authy.com/ - Authenticator App
- https://www.yubico.com/ - Physical Authenticator Key
Why use Google Authenticator? It's stupid and it's made by google.

> Discord Mods
- https://openasar.dev/
OpenAsar is a discord bootstrapper that rewrites some of the desktop portions of Discords app which unintentionally makes it run faster and quicker. You can also enable some privacy features within it.

## Discord bots
> https://sapph.xyz/ - Management bot
Sapphire is the all-in-one discord bot that replaces Mee6 and Dyno. All of it's features are completely free unlike Mee6 and Dyno and yet it has all of their features and more.

> https://discohook.org/ - Webhooks
Also comes with a bot that can be used to edit, make reaction roles and restore webhooks.
